# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Takes a dataset from glassdoor jobs.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.6  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data Cleaning
Before using the data from glassdor, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the company’s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    * Python  
    * R  
    * Excel  
    * AWS  
    * Spark 
*	Column for simplified job title and Seniority 
*	Column for description length 

## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.

## Model Building 

First, I transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables. I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.   

I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers aren’t particularly bad in for this type of model.   

I tried three different models:
*	**Multiple Linear Regression** – Baseline for the model
*	**Lasso Regression** – Because of the sparse data from the many categorical variables, I thought a normalized regression like lasso would be effective.
*	**Random Forest** – Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit. 

## Model performance
The Random Forest model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets. 
*	**Random Forest** : MAE = 11.21
*	**Linear Regression**: MAE = BAD
*	**Ridge Regression**: MAE = 19.67
